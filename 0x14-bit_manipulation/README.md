What is the bit manipulation?
Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word

How do you solve bit manipulation?
Bit Manipulation (Complete Guide) - InterviewBit
Check if a number is a power of 2: A nice Bit Manipulation based approach to solve this problem is to observe the fact that all powers of two have only 1 bit (MSB) set in their binary representation. So, when we subtract 1 from any power of 2, the set bit gets unset, and all the bits coming after it, gets set
