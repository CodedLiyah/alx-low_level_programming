0x10. C - Variadic functions

stdarg.h is a header in the C standard library of the C programming language that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.[1] It provides facilities for stepping through a list of function arguments of unknown number and type. C++ provides this functionality in the header cstdarg.

The contents of stdarg.h are typically used in variadic functions, though they may be used in other functions (for example, vprintf) called by variadic functions.
